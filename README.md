# art_gradshow
A simple respondsive design for art student graduation show website. Note that the images used to demo the web are all free online resources from https://pixabay.com/. Please contact the author, if there is any forms of infringement. 

This implementation is dedicated to minimise the usage of JS, as I wanted to practice my pure css skill. In other words, the implementation would be much simpler and neater with jQuery. 

Note that in the current version, only John Doe A is clickable, which will shows up the modal for the artist.
